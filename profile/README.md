First of all, I will use whatever tools I damn well please, and I don't need anyone's permission to do so. 
I’m not here to criticize the tools others use to create their work, and I expect the same respect in return. 
Creativity thrives on innovation, and tools—whether traditional or cutting-edge—are extensions of the artist’s vision.

Second, my use of technology, including AI, is intentional and integral to the statement I’m making. 
It’s part of how I engage with our fast-paced, ever-changing world. 
Technology is not a crutch; it’s a tool—just like a camera is for a photographer. 
Photographers don’t paint the scenes they capture; they press the shutter to frame life as it happens. 
They consider lighting, composition, post-processing, and the story they want to tell. 
Similarly, I use AI and other tools to conceptualize, reference, and collaborate—to amplify my creativity and accelerate my ability to respond to the world around me.

Third, let me be clear: the anagrams I create are entirely my own. 
AI, for all its linguistic capabilities, isn’t even close to achieving the level of complexity and nuance I bring to this craft. 
If it were, you'd see intricate anagrams flooding the internet. 
But you don’t, because this is a skill rooted in human ingenuity and passion—not something a machine can replicate.

I refuse to let anyone box me in or dictate what tools I can or cannot use. 
My embrace of AI and technology is no different from anyone else in their profession using the tools they’re passionate about. 
It’s how I stay engaged, learn, and evolve in a rapidly advancing world. 
To me, AI is part of our shared reality, our environment—for better or worse. 
Ignoring it would be akin to ignoring the tides or the seasons; it’s here, and it’s shaping how we create, work, and live.

I will not apologize for embracing AI to enhance my creative process. 
I see it as a means to push boundaries, to explore ideas faster, and to collaborate in ways that weren’t possible before. 
This isn’t about replacing creativity—it’s about augmenting it. 
I won’t stifle my designs, censor my work unnecessarily, or limit my expression because someone else is uncomfortable with progress. 
I’ll be mindful of my audience and thoughtful about my message, but I won’t shy away from challenging norms or exploring new frontiers.

This is my stance, and it’s one I’ll continue to refine and stand by. 
Creativity is limitless, and so are the tools we can use to express it. 
For those who can’t accept that—it’s your box, not mine.
